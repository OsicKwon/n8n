## Guidance & Tips/Tricks


### [😭 Things I wish I knew earlier about n8n (for total beginners)](https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1owr59x/things_i_wish_i_knew_earlier_about_n8n_for_total/)

1. everything in n8n starts with a trigger.
1. the “Set” node is underrated. It’s basically a rename tool for messy data.
1. don’t build from scratch. Import something similar
1. use the credential manager for APIs. Don’t paste keys into nodes. [example](https://youtu.be/BFw2p8JFhcY?si=L9gD5JuOp_TSU9k6&t=606)
